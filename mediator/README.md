# Mediator Design Pattern

Object that encapsulate how a set of objects interact. These objects don't have to each other and are only loosely coupled. Mediator does the communication between objects and thereby the interaction. Related to Observer because updates and changes can be done using that pattern.

## Where is this pattern used?

* Controller in MVC
